This folder is intended to store all the notebooks you create to explore, test, train, etc. models and code in general.

Naming convention is the suggest by [Cookiecutter](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/#directory-structure): 
- A number (for ordering), the creator's initials, and a short `-` delimited description, e.g. `1.0-jqp-initial-data-exploration`.
